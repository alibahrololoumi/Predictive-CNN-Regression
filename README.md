# Predictive-CNN-Regression
This Repository includes Matlab code (M file) , Trained network which is saved in a (.mat file).
How to use Trained CNN(step by step):
Step1: download the “ekxrmsprop.m” and “Final Train Network.mat” from Github Repositorie
Step2: for using this code you need to separate your joint image and Top column image and Bottom column in three different folders. For predicting knee joints, use a completely white image instead of bottom column.
Step3: Open MATLAB (suggested: Version higher than R2020)
Step4: Open the mFile in a script and press Run.
Step5: in the command window this message is shown “Enter The file location of .mat file(e.g. D:\University\File containing the .mat file\ .mat file name ):” then you need to write the location of .mat file and press the enter key to continue.
Step6: in the command window this message is shown “Enter The File location of Digitized iamge of Top Column(e.g. D:\University\File containing the images ): 
then you need to write the location of Top column Folder and press the enter key to continue.
Step7: in the command window this message is shown “Enter The File location of Digitized iamge of Joint(e.g. D:\University\File containing the images ): 
then you need to write the location of joint Folder and press the enter key to continue.
Step8: in the command window this message is shown “Enter The File location of Digitized iamge of Bottom Column(e.g. D:\University\File containing the images ): 
then you need to write the location of Bottom column Folder and press the enter key to continue.
Step9: wait for a few minutes and then in the command window this message is shown ”Predicted drift:”
